To create RMarkdown documents, one needs to have R installed, available at https://www.r-project.org/. 
Besides this, the R software package 'rmarkdown' is needed, which can be installed by typing 

install.packages("rmarkdown")

in the R Console, or is available via https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html. 


Optional: 
To have a graphical interface compatible with RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), the package knitr needs to be installed as well: 

install.packages("knitr") 

or available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html
