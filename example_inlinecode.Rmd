# A normal distribution
***
We take a sample from a normal distribution

```{r sample}
set.seed(1212)
x <- rnorm(n=10)
```

The mean of our sample is `r mean(x)` and 
the standard deviation is `r sd(x)`. More examples 
of neat rmarkdown tricks can be found at the 
[RStudio website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
hist(x)
```
